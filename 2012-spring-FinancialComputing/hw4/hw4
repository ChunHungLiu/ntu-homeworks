Write a binomial tree program for arithmetic American Asian puts on a 
non-dividend-paying stock. 

Output its price, delta, and gamma. 

The gamma is based on p. 682 with e=0.2. 

Of course, if the holder exercises early, 
the payoff is max(X - average, 0), 
where average means the running average. 

Inputs: 

S (stock price), 
X (strike price), 
t (year), 
n (the total number of periods), 
s (volatility in %), 
r (interest rate in %), 
k (the number of running averages on each node). 

For example, suppose 
S = 95, 
X = 100, 
t = 2, 
n = 100, 
s = 20(%), 
r = 15 (%), 
k = 100. 

For arithmetic American Asian puts, the option price under binomial tree is
about 5.644079, 
the delta is about -0.764680, 
and the gamma is about 0.04535. 

Please send your source code, executable code, and an explanation file (

how to run it? 
what is the time complexity?) 

using the CEIBA system (922 U0270)/CEIBA system (723 M9500) before 01:00 AM
of May 9, 2012. Compress your files into a single file and name it 
StudentID_HW_4 for easy reference. Example: R91723054_HW_4. Even if you 
need to make an appointment with 文國煒 for demonstration because of the 
unusual software you use, you still have to submit the files before the 
deadline.
