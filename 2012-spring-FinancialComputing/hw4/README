==== How to run? ====
Compile the source code:
$ make
Direct run:
$ ./b97501046_hw4
It will ask you to enter argument. Or you can 
$ make test
or
$ ./b97501046_hw4 < test_input
test_input is the input file, format is:

==== How to calculate the call price ====
1. Using s to calculate u,d.
2. Calculate p and 1-p
3. Build the stock price tree ( O(n^2) )
4. Calculate the put payoff of leaf node
5. Calculate the payoff of previous period ( each node:k, O(n^2) nodes --> O(k*n^2) )
6. Using payoff of root node as put's price
7. Calculate Delta
8. Calculate Gamma

Time complexity = O(k*n^2)
