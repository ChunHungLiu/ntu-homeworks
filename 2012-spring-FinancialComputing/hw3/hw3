Write a CRR binomial tree program to price European single-barrier 
down-and-out calls. 

Write anthoer program based on pp. 416--417 to price the same option. 

Inputs:
S (stock price)
X (strike price)
H (barrier)
T (year)
s (volatility in %)
r (risk-free rate in %)
n (number of periods)

Assume H <S. 

The knock-out stock prices on the tree are those that are at or below H. 
For example, suppose 
S = 100
X = 90
H = 80
T = 1 (year)
s = 25 (%)
r = 15 (%)
n=100 

The option price under CRR is about 23.3627 and 
under the other model is 23.5201. 

Please send your source code, executable code, and an explanation file 
(e.g., how to run it? what is the programming language used? 
what is the time complexity?) 

using the CEIBA system (922 U0270)/CEIBA system (723 M9500) before 01:00 AM
of April 25, 2012. Compress your files into a single file and name it 
StudentID_HW_3 for easy reference. Example: R91723054_HW_3. 
Even if you need to make an appointment with 邱暉翔 for demonstration 
because of the unusual software you use, you still have to submit the files
before the deadline.
