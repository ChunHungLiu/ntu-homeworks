==== Language ====
C++
==== How to run? ====
Compile the source code:
$ make
Direct run:
$ ./b97501046_hw3
It will ask you to enter argument. Or you can 
$ make test
or
$ ./b97501046_hw3 < test_input
test_input is the input file, format is:
S
X
H
T
s
r
n
Example:
100
90
80
1
25
15
100
==== How to calculate the call price ====
1. Using s to calculate u,d.
2. Calculate p (p_u/p_o_u) and 1-p (p_d/p_o_d)
3. Build the stock price tree ( O(n^2) )
4. Calculate the put payoff of leaf node
    payoff = max(0, stock price - X)
5. Calculate the payoff of previous period ( O(n^2) )
    payoff = max(0, exp(-r*(T/n))*(p*payoff_u+(1-p)*payoff_d)
6. Output payoff[0] (call price)

Time complexity = O(n^2)
