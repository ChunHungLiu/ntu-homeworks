==== How to run? ====
Compile the source code:
$ make

Direct run:
$ ./b97501046_hw2
It will ask you to enter argument. Or you can 
$ make test
or
$ ./b97501046_hw2 < test_input

test_input is the input file, format is:
S
X
σ
t
n
δ
r
Example:
100
100
0.3
1
100
0.05
0.1

==== How to calculate the put price ====
1. Using σ to calculate u,d.
    u = exp(σ*(t/n))
    d = exp(-σ*(t/n))
2. Calculate p (p_u) and 1-p (p_d)
    p = exp((r-δ)*(t/n))-d/(u-d)
3. Build the stock price tree ( O(n^2) )
4. Calculate the put payoff of leaf node
    payoff = max(0, X - stock price)
5. Calculate the payoff of previous period ( O(n^2) )
    payoff = max( max(0, X - stock price), <-可能提早執行
                  exp(-r*(t/n))*(p*payoff_u+(1-p)*payoff_d)
6. Output payoff[0] (put price)
7. Calculate and output Delta
8. Calculate and output Gamma

Time complexity = O(n^2)
