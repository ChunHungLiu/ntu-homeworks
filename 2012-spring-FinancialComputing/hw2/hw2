Write a binomial tree program to calculate the 

price, 
delta and 
gamma

of American puts on a stock paying a continuous dividend yield.

Inputs: 
S (stock price), 
X (strike price), 
σ (volatility), 
t (year), 
n (the total number of periods), 
δ (continuous dividend yield), 
r (interest rate). 

For example, suppose 
S = 100, 
X = 100, 
σ = 0.3, 
t = 1, 
n = 100, 
δ = 0.05, 
r = 0.1. 

The American put 
price is about 9.5709, 
the delta is about -0.3994 and 
the gamma is about 0.0146. 

Please send your source code, executable code, and an explanation file (how to run it? what is the time complexity?) using the CEIBA system (922 U0270)/CEIBA system (723 M9500) before 01:00 AM of April 4, 2012. Compress your files into a single file and name it StudentID_HW_2 for easy reference. Example: R91723054_HW_2. Even if you need to make an appointment with 邱暉翔 for demonstration because of the unusual software you use, you still have to submit the files before the deadline.
