Write a program to price an x-year European call option on a zero-coupon
bond that matures at year y with a par value of 1 and output its delta. 

Use the trinomial tree for the Hull-White model on pp. 1023ff. 
In particular, use the jmax=jmin version on p. 1031. Delta is the first 
differential of the option price with respect to the bond price. 

The market spot rate curve is A - B e- C t 
(annualized and continuously compounded). 

Inputs: 
x (year), 
y (year), 
a, 
s (%), 
number of partitions n, 
strike price X (% of par), 
A, 
B, 
and C. 

For example, 
the option price is about 0.001023 
and the delta is about 0.0196487 
when 
x = 1, 
y = 4, 
a = 0.1, 
s = 10 (%), 
n = 100, 
X = 90 (%), 
A = 0.2, 
B= 0.15, and 
C=0.1. 

Please send your source code, executable code, and an explanation file 
(how to run it? what is the time complexity?) using the CEIBA system 
(922 U0270)/CEIBA system (723 M9500) before 01:00 AM of June 20, 2012. 

Compress your files into a single file and name it StudentID_HW_6 for 
easy reference. Example: R91723054_HW_6. Even if you need to make an 
appointment with 邱暉翔 for demonstration because of the unusual 
software you use, you still have to submit the files before the deadline.
