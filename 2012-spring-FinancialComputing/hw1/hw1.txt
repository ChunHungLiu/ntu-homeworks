Write a program to calculate all 1-period forward rates from 
zero-coupon bond prices. All times are period-based for convenience.

Inputs: 
    longest maturity n (number of periods), 
    n zero-coupon bond prices (% of par), 
    
Output: 
    all 1-period forward rates f(0,1), f(1,2), ..., f(n-1,n) in %. 
    
For example, assume n=4 and zero-coupon bond prices are [97, 92, 80, 78]. 
The 1-period forward rates are 
f(0,1)=3.0927835, 
f(1,2)=5.4347826, 
f(2,3)=15, 
f(3,4)=2.5641026. 

Please send your source code, executable code, and an explanation file 
(e.g., how to run it?) using the CEIBA system (922 U0270)/
CEIBA system (723 M9500) before 01:00 AM of March 14, 2012. 

Compress your files into a single file and name it StudentID_HW_1 for 
easy reference. Example: R91723054_HW_1. 

Even if you need to make an appointment with 文國煒 for demonstration 
because of the unusual software you use, you still have to submit the 
files before the deadline.
