Write 2 programs for pricing European binary calls 
(pp. 677~682 of the slides) on a non-dividend-paying stock. 

One uses a trinomial tree, and the other the Monte Carlo method. 

Output its price, delta, and gamma from both. 

For trinomial tree, you may use the one on 

p. 590. (If you decide to use the trinomial tree on pp. 591ff, 
the convergence may be slightly better by treating the strike 
price as the barrier in determining your l.) 

For Monte Carlo method, one time step suffices as the lecture notes show. 
If you use any nontrivial ideas in either the trinomial tree or Monte 
Carlo to improve convergence or accuracy, please record them in your 
explaining notes. 

(Antithetic variates, e.g., will not be considered nontrivial.) 

Inputs: 
S (stock price), 
X (strike price), 
t (year), 
n (total number of periods), 
s (volatility in %), 
r (interest rate in %),
m (number of sample paths of simulation; an antithetic method will 
   produce twice that number of paths), and e (see pp. 679ff). 

For example, suppose 

S = 100, 
X = 90, 
t = 2, 
n = 1000, 
s = 40(%), 
r = 5 (%), 
m = 100000, 
and e=0.001. 

For the trinomial tree, the price, delta, and gamma are about 
price = 0.47805, 
delta = 0.006261, 
gamma = -0.000070356, 

respectively. 
For Monte Carlo, our 
price is around [0.48112, 0.48158], our 
delta is around [0.0039934, 0.0092489], and our 
gamma is around [-4.796, 5.1489]. 

Please send your source code, executable code, and an document file 
(what is the formulas you had used? how to run it? what is the time 
complexity?) using the CEIBA system (922 U0270)/CEIBA system 
(723 M9500) before 01:00 AM of May 30, 2012. Compress your files 
into a single file and name it StudentID_HW_5 for easy reference. 

Example: R91723054_HW_5. Even if you need to make an appointment with 
吳承憲 for demonstration because of the unusual software you use, 
you still have to submit the files before the deadline.
