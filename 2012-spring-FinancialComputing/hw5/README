==== Language ====
C++
==== How to run? ====
Compile the source code:
cd into TrinomialTree or MonteCarloMethod
$ make
Directly run:
$ ./b97501046_hw5
It will ask you to enter argument. Or you can 
$ make test
or
$ ./b97501046_hw5 < test_input
test_input is the input file, format is:
S
X 
t
n
s
r
m
e
Example:
100
90
2
1000
40
5
1000000
0.001
==== How to calculate the call price ====
1. Trinomial Tree
    Build Trinomial Tree O(n)
        Use a 2n+1 array as tree
        We only have 2n+1 stock prices (Su^n,Su^n-1...Su,S,Sd...Sd^n-1,Sd^n)
    Calculate payoff from leaf to root O(n*n)
    Calculate delta and gamma.

    => time complexity: O(n*n)

2. Monte Carlo Method
    Calcuate m path O(m)

    => time complexity: O(m)
