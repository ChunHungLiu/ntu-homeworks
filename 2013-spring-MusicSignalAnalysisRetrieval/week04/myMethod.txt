My myEpd.m is modify from endPointDetect in sap.

I use the 'volzcr' method. But the 'volzcr' method in 
endPointDetect.m is soooooooo slow and it is incorrect.

For speed up, I merge the steps of segmentFind(volume>th2)
and expansion step 1, beacuse if volume > th1, then 
volume > th2, so we can merge those two step to avoid while
search.

The original frameZeroMean function is soooooooo slow, so,
I rewrite this method (and polyfit, polyval) to speed up.

Without using frameZeroMean, the speed is faster then using
it, the result is also > 80%. (let epdPrm.zcrRatio = 0.15,
performance: 81.65%)
